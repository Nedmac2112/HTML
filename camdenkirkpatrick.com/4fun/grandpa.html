                    Hey Grandpa, I decided that I would do something different instead of
                    giving
                    you a card this year.
                </p>
                <p>Thank you for always being a kind and loving person. I really enjoy your personality, and I love
                    being
                    around you. You're such an <span class="rainbow">Awesome</span> Grandpa, and I am so blessed to
                    have
                    you in my life! I love you more than you love coffee! ☕❤️ </p>
