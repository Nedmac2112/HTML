              <p><em>HOW DIFFICULT AND FLEXIBLE ARE TRIP ACTIVITIES?</em></p>
              <p>
                You don't have to be a fitness fanatic to enjoy our trips. A
                typical day consists of a personally paced 5-mile hike or
                20-mile bike ride. We're flexible, though ”“ we'll adjust
                distances and levels of difficulty up or down according to
                your abilities and desires.

              <p><em>WHAT ABOUT SINGLE AND SOLO TRAVELERS?</em></p>
              <p>
                Many of our guests travel solo. Solo travelers have the option
                of paying a single supplement for a private room throughout
                the trip. At your request, we will also try to match you up
                with a suitable roommate. If we're unable to do so and you are
                forced into a private room situation, we will only charge you
                50% of the customary single supplement charge (on most trips).
                We recommend talking to one of our Custom Trip Experts if this
                is something you're interested in.

              <p><em>HOW FAR IN ADVANCE DO I NEED TO RESERVE MY TRIP?</em></p>
              <p>
                The farther in advance you book, the better selection of dates
                you'll have. On most trips you'll want to book 3 to 6 months
                out. For holiday trips, you'll want to reserve 6 to 8 months
                out. Rest assured, though, we're also masters at accommodating
                last-minute reservations!

                <em>ARE THE HIKING AND BIKING DISTANCES THE SAME ON FAMILY
                  TRIPS?</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                To accommodate our youngest guests, family hikes and bike
                rides are typically shorter and easier. Our guides are happy
                to keep children entertained while adults/teens opt for a
                challenging hike, bike ride, etc. - distances and levels of
                difficulty for adults and teens are easy to adjust.

              <p>
                We promise an intimate experience with maximum flexibility and
                personal attention. On most trips, we take 2 guides and an
                average of 10 to 12 guests. On family adventures we can
                accommodate up to 18 guests with 3 guides. We are also experts
                at planning exclusive and custom trips ranging from 5 guests
                to 50 or more.

              <p>
                Though our days are busy, there's always downtime to shop,
                relax or visit the spa. At any time during your trip, if you
                feel like putting your feet up instead of opting for the day's
                activities, that's fine. This is your vacation!

              </p>
              <p>
                On adult trips, our minimum age is 16. On designated family
                adventures, we accommodate children as young as 7 (age 6 for
                Yellowstone & age 5 on our Costa Rica Family Adventures).
                Children who share accommodations with one or more adults will
                receive discounts of 10 - 25%, depending upon the trip.
