                        Summit Farms is more than just a rescue centerâ€”it's a community of compassionate individuals
                        dedicated to making a difference in the lives of dogs in need. Founded in 2004 by Brad and Janet
                        Harker, Summit Farms Rescue specializes in rescuing Alaskan dog breeds such as Malamutes and
                        Huskies. Our mission is clear: to adopt and save as many dogs as possible while promoting the
                        welfare of all domestic animals. With over 2,620 adoptions and counting, our impact is felt far
                        beyond our shelter walls. We believe in fostering respect, understanding, and compassion for all
                        creatures, and we're committed to educating our community about the importance of responsible
                        pet
                        ownership. At Summit Farms, every dog's story matters, and we invite you to join us in our
                        mission
                        to create a world where every dog has a loving home
