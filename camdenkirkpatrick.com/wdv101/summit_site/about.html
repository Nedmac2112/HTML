            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>


            <p>Brad and Janet Harker's passion for animals drove them to establish Summit Farms Rescue
                over two decades
                ago. What started as a humble endeavor has evolved into a beacon of hope for countless dogs facing
                uncertain futures. At Summit Farms, every dog's journey is valued, and every life is cherished. </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At Summit Farms Rescue, we're on a mission to make a differenceâ€”one dog at a time. Our commitment extends
                beyond simply finding homes for our furry friends. We strive to educate our community about responsible
                pet ownership, advocate for animal welfare, and create a culture of empathy and kindness towards all
                creatures.</p>
            <h2>Our Impact</h2>
            <p>Since our inception, Summit Farms Rescue has facilitated the adoption of over 2,620 dogs. But our impact
                goes beyond numbers. It's in the wag of a tail, the spark of joy in a dog's eyes, and the bond between a
                pet and their forever family. With each adoption, we're not just changing a dog's life; we're
                transforming entire families and communities.</p>

                our mission, there are countless ways to get involved with Summit Farms Rescue. Together, we can
                continue to be a voice for the voiceless and create a world where every dog is loved, cherished, and
                given the chance to thrive.
