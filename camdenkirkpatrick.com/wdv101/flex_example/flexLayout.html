        <h3>What is C++?</h3>
        <p>
          C++ is a high-level programming language that was developed as an
          extension of the C programming language. It was created by Bjarne
          Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs as an enhancement to the C language.
          C++ is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and performance,
          making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including
          systems software, game development, desktop applications, mobile
          apps, and more.
        </p>
        <span>Key features of C++ include:</span>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ supports classes and
            objects
          </li>

          <li>
            Memory Management: Unlike many high-level languages, C++ provides
            control over memory management.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performance: C++ is known for its high performance, since it
            doesn't need a virtual machine or interpreter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Portability: C++ code can be compiled and executed on various
            platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Standard Template Library (STL): C++ includes a powerful library
            called the Standard Template Library (STL), which gives developers
            access to various data structures.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Setting up your first program</h3>
        <p>
          To create a C++ program, open your IDE of choice, and create a file
          ending in ".cpp" (for example: helloWorld.cpp). Once you have done
          that, you will need to make sure that you have a compiler that is
          compatible with C++ installed, such as G++. After you have installed
          and setup the comiler, you can begin writing your first program in
          C++. In order for your program to input and output, you must write
          <span>"#include &ltiostream&gt"</span> at the beginning of your program. The "#"
          symbol tells your program that whatever follows it is part of the
          Standard Template Library (STL), which is where useful C++ features
          are stored. After that, you will write the "main function", where
          the program will be executed. To write the main function, type: <span>"int
            main() {return 0;}"</span>. This tells the program that if there are no
          errors in your code, then your program should return "0" from the
          main function, which will end your program. This is the setup for
          every C++ program. So far, your C++ program should look like this:
        <pre><span>#include &ltiostream&gt

int main() {

  return 0;
}</span></pre>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Variables, Output, and Execution</h3>
        <p>There are five basic data types that are important to know in C++:
        <ul>
          <li>Integers(int): stores an integer value Ex.(-1, 0, 1)</li>
          <li>Float(float): stores a number with a fractional part Ex.(1.25, 0.67, -5.2)</li>
          <li>String(string): stores an array of characters Ex.("Hello", "Bye!", "100")</li>
          <li>Character(char): stores a single character Ex.('A', '&', '4')</li>
          <li>Boolean(bool): stores the value "True" or "False"</li>
        </ul>
        To declare a variable, you must write the type ( See text in parentheses above), name the variable, and assign
        it a
        value, followed by
        a ';'.
        For example: int x = 20; If you are declaring a string, you must put the value in double quotes, and if you are
        declaring a char, you must put the value in single qoutes (See above)
        In order to ouput to the console, do: <span>std::cout &lt&lt "text you want to print;"</span>
        If you want to print out one of your variables, just do: <span>"std::cout &lt&lt varName;"</span>
        The last step is to compile and execute your program! To compile your program using G++, type the following into
        your terminal: <span>"g++ fileName.cpp -o executableName"</span> The "executableName" will be the name that the
        executable file is assigned to (default is "a.exe"). Now that you have compiled the program, you can now execute
        it. To run your program, type the following into your terminal: <span>"executableName"</span>
